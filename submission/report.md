Firstly, i would like to premise and apolotize for ,y implementation of the assignment wasnt able to be fulfilled fully due to misunderstanding the assignment. I intially worked on function to detect polygon size from the user determined m_points. 

Link to the prompts used overall:
https://gemini.google.com/share/4ef050f488b2

# Task 1
I first analyzed the code and wrote a debug line to see how the custom matrix runs throughout the entire program. Through Gemini AI it refered to 3x3 as the optimal size. 


# Task 2
I then continue to look more into what window pattern was refering to in the task. I then implemented the logic through creating a header file of segments, a comparison function within the CustomMatrix.h file and lastly implemented the pattern detection within the segmentDetection function.

Prompts used: 
"Reporting fitting appropriate window pattern in a 3x3 matrix"
"how to implement comparison in customMatrix"

and after been given example of the patterns i start to rewrite manually some of the bool patterns.

# Task 3
i was unable to implement
